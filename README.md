# nav-mesh-navigation-timeline-elenmets

this is a small set of scripts with which you can add a nav mesh movement into the timeline.

there is an issu: if there is a root motion in the animation you have to remove keyframes with it to apply the nav-mesh motion.

sometimes rotation is not applied in a preview mode.

if the look target is not set it wiil be in the path travel direction
